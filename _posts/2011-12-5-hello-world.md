# Hello World!
Hello world! I've been meaning to make a simple website for my projects and
code and the like, so here it is. If I'm terribly bored I might write things
too. This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) and
[Github pages](http://pages.github.com/), using a template provided by
[bobschi](http://lebobs.ch/) on [github](https://github.com/bobschi/HTML5-Boilerplate-Jekyll-Template).
I picked it completely arbitarily, mainly because I love git and as a frequent
user of mobile browsers, I like websites that are designed to be readable on
screens of all sizes. Plus, with github pages I don't have to worry about
hosting or annoying things like that.

I hope to post updates about research and any random hacking I happen to do.
